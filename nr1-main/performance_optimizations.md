# Performance Optimizations (Python/FastAPI Backend)

All backend performance optimizations are now implemented in Python using FastAPI. Frontend JavaScript/CSS optimizations are no longer relevant. For backend performance, see the FastAPI app and Python service modules. All documentation is in English and the backend is fully compatible with Render.com.
