# Render.com Deployment Checklist (Python/FastAPI Backend)

- [x] Update the project structure to meet Render.com requirements
- [x] Add all necessary configuration files (render.yaml, Dockerfile, requirements.txt, etc.)
- [x] Adjust server paths and settings for production environment
- [x] Add environment and configuration files as needed
- [x] Test compatibility locally before deployment
- [x] Prepare the final deployment package
- [x] Write a clear deployment guide for users

All tasks and notes are now Python/FastAPI only. No references to Node.js, JavaScript, or non-English content remain. The backend is fully compatible with Render.com.
