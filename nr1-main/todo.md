# TODO List: Video Preview and Download Issue Resolution (Python/FastAPI)

- [x] Analyze the root cause of the video preview and download issue
- [x] Create the necessary folder structure for video storage
- [x] Update the code to connect the frontend with real Python/FastAPI backend services
- [x] Add a FastAPI endpoint to serve video files
- [x] Improve compatibility with iPhone and Safari via API responses and headers
- [x] Test the solution on various devices and browsers
- [x] Optimize performance and reduce resource usage
- [x] Deploy the backend for public testing via Render.com

All tasks and notes are now Python/FastAPI only. No references to Node.js, JavaScript, or non-English content remain. The backend is fully compatible with Render.com.
