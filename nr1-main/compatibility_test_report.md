# Compatibility Test Report (Python/FastAPI)

## Summary

Comprehensive compatibility tests were conducted to ensure video preview and download features work across all major devices and browsers. The backend is implemented in Python using FastAPI, and all endpoints are tested for cross-platform compatibility.
