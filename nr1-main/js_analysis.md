# Python/FastAPI Backend Workflow (Current)

This document describes the backend architecture and workflow for the Viral Clip Generator, implemented entirely in Python using FastAPI. All previous JavaScript/Node.js logic has been fully replaced with Python code. The backend is modular, production-ready, and deployable on Render.com.

## Main Backend Functions

1. **Validate YouTube URL**: Receives a YouTube URL and validates it using Python logic.
2. **Download Video**: Downloads the video using Python services (e.g., `pytube` or direct download logic).
3. **Analyze Video**: Uses Python-based video analysis (e.g., with `ffmpeg-python`) to identify highlights.
4. **Process and Add Audio Effects**: Processes the video and merges audio effects using Python and FFmpeg.
5. **Serve Result**: Returns the processed video for download or streaming via FastAPI endpoints.

## Example Python Endpoint (FastAPI)

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.services.video_service import process_video_job_service

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/process")
def process_video(data: dict):
    try:
        result = process_video_job_service(data)
        return {"status": "success", "result": result}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))
```

## General Workflow

1. **User Input**: The user submits a YouTube URL via the frontend.
2. **API Request**: The frontend sends the URL to the FastAPI backend.
3. **Validation & Processing**: The backend validates, downloads, analyzes, and processes the video using Python services.
4. **Job Queue**: Long-running tasks are handled asynchronously using Redis-backed RQ workers.
5. **Result Delivery**: The processed video is stored and served via FastAPI endpoints.

## Technical Notes

- All code is in English and follows Python best practices.
- All business logic, integrations, and endpoints are implemented in Python.
- The backend is modular, maintainable, and ready for production deployment.
- The codebase is fully compatible with Render.com deployment.
