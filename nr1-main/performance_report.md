# Performance Report (Python/FastAPI Backend)

All backend performance improvements are now implemented in Python using FastAPI. Frontend JavaScript/CSS performance reporting is no longer relevant. For backend performance, see the FastAPI app and Python service modules. All documentation is in English and the backend is fully compatible with Render.com.
